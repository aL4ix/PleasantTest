* A normal Page Object is separated into two, Page and Mapping
* Mapping only lists the elements, the xpaths and a "implements"
* "implements" describes what kind of behaviour the element is going to have, like a combobox, normally you should use Select for interacting with it, but mostly it never works because the JS frameworks implement their own comboboxes, so instead of adding different code, you just use a different implements, like bootstrapCombobox and then all the previous commands work
